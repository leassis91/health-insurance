## üìñ Background

*The following context is completely fictional.*

Insurance All is a company that provides health insurance to its customers and the product team is analyzing the possibility of offering policyholders a new product: vehicle insurance. New customers of this product will pay an amount annually to Insurance All to obtain an amount insured by the company, intended at the costs of an eventual accident or damage to the vehicle.

Insurance All conducted a survey for over 380,000 customers about their interest in joining a new vehicle insurance product last year. The responses results were saved in a database along with other customer attributes.

## üìå Problem Statement

*Ranking customers interested in purchasing vehicle insurance.*

The survey obtained feedback from 304,000 customers about their interest in purchasing vehicle insurance. The new insurance was developed and is being offered to the interested parties. However, there are more than 76,000 customers who did not respond to the survey. The already busy call center has the capacity to contact only 20,000 of these potential customers. Therefore, we need a list ordered by interest of these 76k customers, in order to optimize the company's conversion and revenue.

## üî¨ Solution Approach

The approach used to solve this task was done by applying CRISP-DM¬π methodology, which was divided in the following parts:

1. **Data Description:** understanding of the status of the database and dealing with missing values properly. Basic statistics metrics furnish an overview of the data.  
2. **Feature Engineering:** derivation of new attributes based on the original variables aiming to better describe the phenomenon that will be modeled, and to supply interesting attributes for the Exploratory Data Analysis.
3. **Feature Filtering:** filtering of records and selection of attributes that do not contain information for modeling or that do not match the scope of the business problem.
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** exploration of the data searching for insights and seeking to understand the impact of each variable on the upcoming machine learning modeling.
5. **Data Preparation:** preprocessing stage required prior to the machine learning modeling step.
6. **Feature Selection:** selection of the most significant attributes for training the model.
7. **Machine Learning Modeling:** implementation of a few algorithms appropriate to the task at hand. In this case, models befitting the *regression* assignment - *i.e.*, forecasting a continuous value, namely sales.
8. **Hyperparameter Fine Tuning:** search for the best values for each of the parameters of the best performing model(s) selected from the previous step.
9. **Statistical Error Analysis:** conversion of the performance metrics of the Machine Learning model to a more tangible business result.
10. **Production Deployment:** deployment of the model in a cloud environment (Heroku), using Flask connected to our model in a pickle file.
11. **Telegram Bot:** deployment of Telegram Bot API, here used as our user receiver. Check out at "Deployment" section.

## Project designed to rank customers interested in purchasing a vehicle insurance.

#### This project was made by Leandro Destefani.

# 1. Business Problem.

A Insurance All √© uma empresa tradicional de seguros de sa√∫de. Ela pretende lan√ßar agora um novo produto ems eu portf√≥lio, seguro de autom√≥veis. Para isso, realizaram uma pesquisa entre seus milhares de clientes para coletar informa√ß√µes relevantes. 

A empresa quer que fa√ßamos um estudo sobre os dados repassados para que possamos criar um modelo eficiente e assertivo em rela√ß√£o ao n√∫mero de clientes que aceitariam a contrata√ß√£o do novo produto, j√° que n√£o seria vi√°vel (custo com liga√ß√£o, tempo de contato, etc.) realizar uma pesquisa individual com todos os clientes. 

Devemos ent√£o otimizar uma lista para a empresa com as pessoas com maior probabilidade de realizar a compra.
