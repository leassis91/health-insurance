## üìñ Background

*The following context is completely fictional.*

Insurance All is a company that provides health insurance to its customers and the product team is analyzing the possibility of offering policyholders a new product: auto insurance.

As with health insurance, customers of this new auto insurance plan need to pay an amount annually to Insurance All to obtain an amount insured by the company, aimed at the costs of an eventual accident or damage to the vehicle.

Insurance All conducted a survey of about 380,000 customers about their interest in joining a new auto insurance product last year. All customers expressed interest or not in purchasing auto insurance and these responses were saved in a database along with other customer attributes.

The product team selected 127 thousand new customers who did not respond to the survey to participate in a campaign, in which they will receive the offer of the new auto insurance product. The offer will be made by the sales team through telephone calls.

However, the sales team has the capacity to make 20 thousand calls within the campaign period.

## üî¨ Solution Approach

The approach used to solve this task was done by applying CRISP-DM¬π methodology, which was divided in the following parts:

1. **Data Description:** understanding of the status of the database and dealing with missing values properly. Basic statistics metrics furnish an overview of the data.  
2. **Feature Engineering:** derivation of new attributes based on the original variables aiming to better describe the phenomenon that will be modeled, and to supply interesting attributes for the Exploratory Data Analysis.
3. **Feature Filtering:** filtering of records and selection of attributes that do not contain information for modeling or that do not match the scope of the business problem.
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** exploration of the data searching for insights and seeking to understand the impact of each variable on the upcoming machine learning modeling.
5. **Data Preparation:** preprocessing stage required prior to the machine learning modeling step.
6. **Feature Selection:** selection of the most significant attributes for training the model.
7. **Machine Learning Modeling:** implementation of a few algorithms appropriate to the task at hand. In this case, models befitting the *regression* assignment - *i.e.*, forecasting a continuous value, namely sales.
8. **Hyperparameter Fine Tuning:** search for the best values for each of the parameters of the best performing model(s) selected from the previous step.
9. **Statistical Error Analysis:** conversion of the performance metrics of the Machine Learning model to a more tangible business result.
10. **Production Deployment:** deployment of the model in a cloud environment (Heroku), using Flask connected to our model in a pickle file.
11. **Telegram Bot:** deployment of Telegram Bot API, here used as our user receiver. Check out at "Deployment" section.

## Project designed to rank customers interested in purchasing a vehicle insurance.

#### This project was made by Leandro Destefani.

# 1. Business Problem.

A Insurance All √© uma empresa tradicional de seguros de sa√∫de. Ela pretende lan√ßar agora um novo produto ems eu portf√≥lio, seguro de autom√≥veis. Para isso, realizaram uma pesquisa entre seus milhares de clientes para coletar informa√ß√µes relevantes. 

A empresa quer que fa√ßamos um estudo sobre os dados repassados para que possamos criar um modelo eficiente e assertivo em rela√ß√£o ao n√∫mero de clientes que aceitariam a contrata√ß√£o do novo produto, j√° que n√£o seria vi√°vel (custo com liga√ß√£o, tempo de contato, etc.) realizar uma pesquisa individual com todos os clientes. 

Devemos ent√£o otimizar uma lista para a empresa com as pessoas com maior probabilidade de realizar a compra.
